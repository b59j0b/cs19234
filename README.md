Title: The   Impact of Prize   Pool   Distribution on   Player Effort   and   Team   Performance   in CS   Esports Tournaments   Introduction
The growth of esports   has significantly   reshaped the landscape of competitive   gaming,   turning   it   into a   billion-dollar industry. One of the core   components that   motivate   participants   in esports tournaments   is the structure of the   prize   pool.   Understanding   how   different   prize   pool distributions affect   player effort and team   performance   is crucial for stakeholders   like tournament organizers and sponsors. The design of the   prize   pool   could   maximize   not only   player engagement   but also viewer satisfaction, thereby   enhancing the economic sustainability of esports.
My research focuses on the question: How does prize pool distribution   (X) affect   player   effort and team performance   (Y) in   CS esports tournaments? This question   aims to   uncover the   influence of financial   incentives on performance within an industry where prize   pool structures can vary substantially,   impacting   individual and team   motivations.      This study could   provide valuable   insights   into designing optimal   incentive   mechanisms   that encourage   higher levels of effort and engagement   in a   dynamic,   high-frequency   competition like   esports.
Literature   Review
This   research   builds upon several foundational   papers   in tournament theory and incentive structures.   Lazear and   Rosen (1981)   provided one of the earliest   and   most   influential examinations of tournament theory, demonstrating that larger   prize differences can drive   increased   participant effort. This finding   is   highly relevant to   esports, where prize pool distributions vary significantly   between tournaments. Applying   their theory to the esports context allows us to   examine whether   larger financial   incentives translate   into greater player effort and improved   team   performance.
Ehrenberg and   Bognanno (1990) examined the role   of financial   incentives   in golf   tournaments, finding that   larger prizes led to better   performance.   This   paper   provides   a   useful   comparison   foresports, as   both   golf   and   esports   involve   individual   and   team   dynamics   influenced   by financial   rewards.   By extending   Ehrenberg and   Bognanno's analysis to the context of esports, this study will explore whether similar   incentive   effects   are   present   in   high-frequency, short-duration esports tournaments.The study   by "AI-enabled   prediction of video game   player performance using   the   data      from sensors" (2022),   presents an artificial   intelligence solution for   predicting   esports         player performance using sensor data.   By collecting   physiological, environmental,   and   smart chair data from both   professional and amateur   players, the   study   assesses in-game   performance through a   recurrent   neural   network, offering   insights   into factors   influencing   player outcomes. This   research   provides a technological angle on how   various factors   impact   player   performance, complementing the analysis of prize   pool   incentives.
Another recent study, "Fighting fair: community perspectives   on   the   fairness   of   performance enhancers   in esports" (2024) explores the competitive   gaming community's opinions on various performance enhancers and their   potential   impact   on   esports. Through qualitative and quantitative surveys, the   research   identifies   key themes   in   how   players   rationalize their views on fairness and   performance   enhancement. This   perspective   helps to understand   how fairness considerations can   influence   player behavior. and engagement   in esports tournaments.
Finally, The   research titled "Performance   analysis   in esports:   part   1" (2024)   focuses   on   the validity and reliability of match statistics   and   notational   analysis   in   "League   of   Legends."

Data
The analysis will   utilize data from   multiple esports databases,   including   HLTV.org,   Liquipedia, and   Esports   Earnings. These sources   provide detailed   information on CS tournaments, such as   prize   pool   breakdowns,   player and team statistics, and   match outcomes. The sample   population comprises professional CS   players   and teams who   have   participated   in tournaments from approximately 2015 to the present.
Key variables for this analysis   include the structure of the   prize   pool (total   pool   and payout   format,such   as   winner-takes-all   vs. tiered   distributions),team   performance   metrics (e.g., win-loss   records,   rankings, and standings), and individual   player   statistics   (e.g.,   kills, deaths, damage   per round). The data can   be   accessed   through   public APIs      or web scraping, ensuring a comprehensive and timely dataset for the   analysis.
Empirical Strategy
To evaluate the causal   impact of prize   pool distribution   on   player effort   and   team performance,   I will employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. This   method will   compare changes   in effort and   performance   metrics across tournaments   before and
after changes   in   prize   pool structure, while controlling for confounding variables. The   specific equation to   be estimated   is:
Individual
Yirt   = α +   β   ×   Treatment   + Xᵢ   +   δrt    +   εᵢᵣ
●          Yirt: Outcome variable representing   player or team   performance for   team   i   at   time   t.
●          Treatment:   Indicator variable for tournaments with altered   prize pool   distribution   (e.g., tiered vs. winner-takes-all).
●          Xᵢᵣ: Control variables, such as   historical   performance,   player   rank,   and team   composition.
●          δᵣ: Time fixed effects to   control   for time-specific   variations.
●          β: The   key coefficient   of interest,   representing   the   effect   of   prize   distribution   structure on performance   outcomes.
Team   Level:
Yᵣgt    = αᵣgt    +   β ×   Treatment   + Ɣt   +   ωg   +   εᵣgt
●          Yrgt: Outcome variable representing team   performance for team   g   in   tournament   r   attime   t.
●          β: The   key coefficient   of interest,   representing   the   effect   of   prize   distribution   structure on performance   outcomes.
●          Treatment:   Indicator variable for tournaments with altered   prize pool   distribution   (e.g., tiered vs. winner-takes-all).
●            Ɣt   : Time fixed effects to   control for time-specific variations.
●            ωg   : Team fixed effects to control for team-specific characteristics.
●          εᵣgt:   Error term capturing any   unobserved factors   affecting   performance.
The   DiD approach   is   particularly suited to this   research as   it   helps   isolate the effect   of   prize   pool changes   by comparing   performance   between treated and untreated groups over time. To address   potential endogeneity   issues,   robustness checks will   be   conducted,   including   instrumental variable (IV)   methods, such as using tournament   size   as an   instrument. This empirical strategy will   provide robust evidence   on   how   financial incentives   impact effort and   performance   in esports, which can offer valuable guidance      to tournament organizers   in optimizing   prize pool structures.
Conclusion
This   research   proposal seeks to explore the   intricate   relationship   between   prize   pool   distribution and   player effort   in the esports   industry.   By drawing on established economic theories and utilizing   high-quality tournament data, this study   aims to   contribute to   both the esports and economics literature,   offering   actionable   insights for   tournament organizers and stakeholders   in this rapidly growing   industry.
